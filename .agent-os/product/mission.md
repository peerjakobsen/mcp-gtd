# Product Mission

## Pitch

GTD Manager is an MCP server that helps team leads with extreme context switching manage their tasks and meetings efficiently by implementing Getting Things Done methodology with intelligent meeting management and action tracking.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Team Leads**: Technical and non-technical leaders managing 5-15 direct reports
- **Engineering Managers**: Leaders juggling multiple projects and stakeholder meetings

### User Personas

**Overwhelmed Team Lead** (30-45 years old)

- **Role:** Engineering Manager or Team Lead
- **Context:** Manages 8-12 direct reports, attends 15-20 meetings per week
- **Pain Points:** Constant context switching, losing track of action items, inefficient meeting preparation
- **Goals:** Capture all commitments reliably, reduce cognitive load, maximize meeting effectiveness

**Senior Manager** (35-50 years old)

- **Role:** Director or Senior Manager
- **Context:** Oversees multiple teams, heavy meeting schedule with executives and ICs
- **Pain Points:** Information scattered across tools, difficulty tracking delegated items, meeting follow-ups get lost
- **Goals:** Maintain trusted system for all commitments, delegate effectively, never drop the ball

## The Problem

### Extreme Context Switching

Team leads average 15-20 meetings per week with constant interruptions. Studies show it takes 23 minutes to refocus after context switching, leading to 50% productivity loss.

**Our Solution:** GTD-based capture system that works seamlessly with MCP-enabled AI assistants.

### Meeting Action Item Tracking

Action items from meetings are often lost in notes or chat. 70% of meeting action items are never completed due to poor tracking.

**Our Solution:** Automated action extraction from meeting notes with SOP-driven workflows.

### Scattered Information

Commitments live in email, chat, docs, and memory. Managers spend 2+ hours daily just organizing information across tools.

**Our Solution:** Unified GTD inbox accessible via AI assistant with flexible storage (Quip API or local markdown).

## Differentiators

### AI-Native GTD Implementation

Unlike traditional GTD apps, we're built specifically for AI assistant integration. This means natural language capture and processing without context switching from your coding environment.

### Document-Driven Meeting SOPs

Unlike rigid meeting templates, our markdown-based SOPs adapt to your organization's specific meeting types. This flexibility allows custom workflows while maintaining GTD principles.

### Flexible Storage Backend

Unlike cloud-only solutions, we support both Quip API integration and local markdown files. This ensures data sovereignty and works in any environment.
