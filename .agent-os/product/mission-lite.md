# Product Mission (Lite)

GTD Manager is a generalized MCP server that implements Getting Things Done methodology, customizable through user-created Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents for managing tasks, meetings, and workflows.

GTD Manager serves team leads and managers who need a flexible GTD system that adapts to their specific organizational processes. Unlike rigid task management tools, it provides a GTD foundation that users customize by writing markdown SOPs for their unique meeting types, workflows, and review processes. The system integrates seamlessly with AI assistants via MCP protocol and supports both cloud storage (Quip API) and local markdown files.
