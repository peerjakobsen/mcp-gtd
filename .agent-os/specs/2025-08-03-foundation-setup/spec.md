## Overview

Establish proper Python 3.13 + FastMCP project structure following MCP server best practices for the GTD Manager MCP Server. This foundation will ensure robust, maintainable, and protocol-compliant MCP server implementation from the start.

## User Stories

### Project Structure Reorganization

As a developer, I want to reorganize the existing code into a proper FastMCP project structure, so that the codebase follows Python packaging best practices and MCP server conventions.

The current repository has basic files but lacks the proper src/package structure needed for a professional Python project. We need to move existing MCP server code into src/gtd_manager/ and establish proper entry points, configuration, and tooling.

### MCP Protocol Compliance

As an MCP client user, I want the server to follow all MCP protocol requirements, so that it works reliably with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients without communication failures.

Critical requirements include never contaminating stdout (which breaks MCP JSON-RPC communication), proper structured logging to stderr, and robust error handling with user-friendly messages.

### Development Environment Setup

As a developer, I want a complete development environment with proper tooling, so that I can efficiently develop, test, and debug the MCP server with confidence.

This includes Python 3.13+ environment, uv package management, comprehensive testing setup with stdout cleanliness verification, linting, type checking, and database management tools.

## Spec Scope

1. **Project Structure** - Reorganize code into proper src/gtd_manager/ package structure with entry points
2. **FastMCP Integration** - Set up FastMCP server framework with proper initialization and tool registration
3. **MCP Best Practices** - Implement critical protocol compliance patterns from day one
4. **Development Tooling** - Configure uv, pytest, ruff, mypy, and other development tools
5. **Database Foundation** - Set up smart database path detection for multiple deployment environments

## Out of Scope

- Actual GTD functionality implementation (handled in subsequent specs)
- PostgreSQL integration (will use SQLite initially)
- UI/web interface components
- External API integrations (Quip, etc.)
- Advanced deployment configurations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working FastMCP server that starts without errors and responds to basic MCP protocol commands
2. Proper Python package structure with src/gtd_manager/ layout and all imports working
3. Complete test suite running successfully with stdout cleanliness verification
