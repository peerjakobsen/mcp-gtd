# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-03-phase0-completion/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Domain Model Architecture**: Use Python dataclasses with inheritance hierarchy (GTDItem base → Action/Project specializations)
- **GTD Workflow States**: Implement enum for item lifecycle (inbox, clarified, organized, reviewing, complete, someday)
- **Database Schema**: SQLite tables with foreign key constraints and appropriate indexes for query performance
- **Entity Relationships**: One-to-many Project→Actions, many-to-many Action→Context relationships
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Created, updated, completed timestamps with automatic maintenance
- **Data Validation**: Field validation using Python type hints and validation decorators
- **Migration System**: Schema versioning with upgrade/downgrade capabilities
- **Connection Management**: Reuse existing database connection patterns from current codebase
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses following existing FastMCP error patterns
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests for all domain models and database operations

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies needed - uses existing FastMCP, SQLite, and structlog dependencies from current tech stack.
