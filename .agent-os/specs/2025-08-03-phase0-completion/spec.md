# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Phase 0 Completion - Core Domain Models & Database Schema
> Created: 2025-08-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete Phase 0 by implementing core GTD domain models (GTDItem, Action, Project entities) and setting up the database schema with proper tables, relationships, and migrations. This establishes the foundational data layer for the GTD management system.

## User Stories

### Domain Model Foundation

As a GTD system architect, I want to define core domain entities with proper relationships, so that the system can represent GTD workflows accurately and maintain data integrity.

The domain model should include GTDItem as the base entity with Action and Project as specialized types. Items flow through GTD stages (inbox → clarified → organized → reviewed) with proper state tracking, context assignment, and project relationships.

### Database Schema Implementation

As a GTD system user, I want reliable data persistence with proper schema design, so that my tasks, projects, and contexts are stored safely with good query performance.

The database should support the full GTD lifecycle with foreign key relationships, appropriate indexes for common queries, and migration capabilities for schema evolution.

## Spec Scope

1. **GTDItem base entity** - Core item with title, description, status, timestamps, and GTD workflow state
2. **Action specialized entity** - Actionable items with due dates, energy levels, time estimates, and contexts
3. **Project specialized entity** - Multi-step outcomes with success criteria and action collections
4. **Context entity** - GTD contexts (@computer, @phone, @meeting) for action organization
5. **Database schema migration** - SQLite tables with proper constraints, indexes, and relationships

## Out of Scope

- User interface for managing entities (Phase 1)
- External integrations or APIs (Phase 4)
- Multi-user support (Phase 5)
- Quip or external storage (Phase 4)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Core domain models implemented in Python with proper inheritance and relationships
2. Database schema created with migrations supporting full GTD workflow
3. All tests passing including new domain model and database tests
