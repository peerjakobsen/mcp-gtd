"""
Integration tests for GTD Manager with realistic team lead scenarios.

This test suite exercises complete GTD workflows through the domain layer,
simulating real-world scenarios that team leads encounter daily.

Key Integration Scenarios:
- Team Lead Weekly Processing: Meeting outcomes â†’ organized actions
- Cross-Organizational Projects: Internal/customer/partner coordination
- Context Switching: Energy-based filtering for time management
- Large Data Performance: Bulk operations and realistic volumes

All tests use the repository layer directly to validate business logic
before MCP tools are implemented on top.
