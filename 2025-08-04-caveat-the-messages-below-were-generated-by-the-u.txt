✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to implement task 2 from the GTD project, but I'm in plan mode, so
  I need to research and understand what task 2 entails, then present a comprehensive
  plan without making any changes.

  Let me first understand what task 2 is by reading the tasks.md file.

  From what I read earlier, task 2 is "Database Schema Setup" with these subtasks:
  - 2.1 Write tests for database schema creation and migration system
  - 2.2 Create migration system with schema versioning and rollback support
  - 2.3 Write tests for gtd_items table operations and constraints
  - 2.4 Implement gtd_items table with proper constraints and triggers
  - 2.5 Write tests for contexts table and action_contexts relationship table
  - 2.6 Create contexts and action_contexts tables with foreign key relationships
  - 2.7 Write tests for database indexes and query performance
  - 2.8 Add database indexes for common query patterns
  - 2.9 Verify all database schema tests pass

  I need to understand the current state of the codebase first to plan this properly.
  I've already started reading some files, but let me get a comprehensive
  understanding.

  From what I've seen:
  1. There's already a database.py module with basic connection management and path
  detection
  2. There's already an init_database function that creates a schema_version table
  3. There are domain models defined in the models/ directory (GTDItem, Action,
  Project, Context, Stakeholder, etc.)
  4. There are existing database tests in test_database.py

  I need to plan:
  1. Understanding the current database schema needs based on the domain models
  2. Creating a proper migration system
  3. Implementing the actual database tables for the GTD domain models
  4. Writing comprehensive tests for all of this
  5. Adding proper indexes for performance

  Let me continue my research to understand the domain models better.

⏺ I'll research the current state and plan the implementation of task 2: Database
  Schema Setup. Let me first understand what needs to be implemented by examining the
  current codebase.

  Now I need to understand the domain models to know what database schema needs to be
  created. Let me examine the models that were implemented in task 1.

  I need to research the current state of the codebase to understand what's been
  implemented in task 1 and what needs to be done for task 2. I should look at the
  domain models, existing database code, and current test structure to plan the
  database schema implementation.

  Let me examine the domain models first to understand what database tables and
  relationships need to be created.

     ## Purpose
     … +40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have researched the current state thoroughly. Let me understand what needs to
  be implemented for Task 2: Database Schema Setup. Based on my analysis:

  Current State Analysis:

  1. Domain Models: Task 1 has been completed - all domain models are implemented:
    - GTDItem base class with workflow states and stakeholder relationships
    - Action class inheriting from GTDItem with contexts, due dates, energy levels
    - Project class inheriting from GTDItem with success criteria and action
  collections
    - Context entity for organizing actions by GTD contexts (@computer, @phone, etc.)
    - Organization, Team, Stakeholder classes for RACI stakeholder management
    - GTDItemStakeholder junction model with business rule enforcement
    - Enums: GTDStatus, RACIRole, OrganizationType
  2. Current Database Setup:
    - Basic database path detection and connection management exists
    - Only has schema_version table for version tracking
    - Basic init_database() function exists but only creates schema_version table
    - No actual domain tables created yet
  3. Required Schema: From the database-schema.md spec:
    - gtd_items table (base table for all GTD items)
    - contexts table (GTD contexts like @computer, @phone)
    - action_contexts junction table (many-to-many Actions ↔ Contexts)
    - Stakeholder-related tables would be needed but aren't mentioned in Task 2 scope
    - Indexes for performance
    - Triggers for timestamp updates
    - Migration system with versioning
  4. Task 2 Breakdown:
    - 2.1 Write tests for database schema creation and migration system
    - 2.2 Create migration system with schema versioning and rollback support
    - 2.3 Write tests for gtd_items table operations and constraints
    - 2.4 Implement gtd_items table with proper constraints and triggers
    - 2.5 Write tests for contexts table and action_contexts relationship table
    - 2.6 Create contexts and action_contexts tables with foreign key relationships
    - 2.7 Write tests for database indexes and query performance
    - 2.8 Add database indexes for common query patterns
    - 2.9 Verify all database schema tests pass

  I'll focus on systematically building out the database infrastructure, ensuring each
  component is thoroughly tested and aligned with the domain model requirements. The
  key is creating a robust, performant schema that can reliably persist and retrieve
  GTD-related data while maintaining data integrity and supporting complex querying
  needs.

  The next critical steps involve designing a flexible migration system that allows for
   seamless schema evolution, implementing core tables with precise constraints, and
  establishing efficient indexing strategies. I'll prioritize creating comprehensive
  test coverage to validate each aspect of the database layer.

⏺ Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see that Task 1 (Core Domain Models) has
  been completed with comprehensive Python dataclass models, and now Task 2 needs to
  implement the database schema layer to persist these models. Let me present my
  implementation plan.

> If a user update to a new version of the server there might be database schema
  changes. Can we sometimes have such big changes that we could lose data? What can we
  do about that? Think hard.

✻ Thinking…

  This is an excellent question about database schema evolution and data preservation.
  Let me think through the potential scenarios and risks:

  Potential Data Loss Scenarios

  1. Column Type Changes: Converting VARCHAR to INTEGER could lose data if existing
  data doesn't convert cleanly
  2. Column Removal: Dropping columns permanently loses that data
  3. Table Restructuring: Moving from one table structure to another (like splitting or
   merging tables)
  4. Constraint Changes: Adding NOT NULL constraints to existing columns with null
  values
  5. Primary Key Changes: Changing primary key structure could require data
  transformation
  6. Foreign Key Changes: Modifying relationships could orphan data

  Real-World MCP Server Considerations

  Since this is an MCP server that users install via uvx and may have been running for
  months or years, we need to be especially careful:

  - Users may have accumulated significant GTD data
  - They may not understand database concepts or have backup strategies
  - Automatic updates via uvx could apply schema changes without warning
  - No IT support - users are on their own

  Data Preservation Strategies

  1. Backup Before Migration: Always create full database backup before schema changes
  2. Reversible Migrations: Design migrations that can be rolled back
  3. Data Transformation Scripts: When restructuring, preserve data through careful
  transformation
  4. Staged Migration: Multi-step migrations that validate data at each step
  5. Schema Versioning: Clear version tracking to know what migrations to apply
  6. Migration Testing: Test migrations on copies of real user data
  7. Graceful Degradation: If migration fails, preserve original data and log errors

  Specific Techniques

  Backup Strategy

  - Before any migration, create timestamped backup: data_backup_v1_to_v2_20241201.db
  - Store backups in user data directory alongside main database
  - Provide tool to restore from backup if needed

  Safe Column Operations

  - Adding columns: Always add with DEFAULT values

  - Removing columns requires a careful, phased approach to minimize data loss
  - Type conversions demand meticulous data transformation techniques

  Migration Complexity

  I'll carefully manage column and table modifications to ensure data integrity. This
  means creating new structures, migrating existing data with precision, and
  implementing robust validation checks. The goal is to transform the database schema
  while preserving every piece of critical user information.

  Error Mitigation

  Migrations are inherently risky, especially for long-running systems with accumulated
   data. I'll implement comprehensive logging, validation checkpoints, and automatic
  rollback mechanisms to protect against potential data corruption or loss.

  User Trust Considerations

  For mission-critical systems like an MCP server managing personal task management,
  every migration step must prioritize data preservation. Users rely on these platforms
   to organize their most important workflows, so any potential data disruption could
  be catastrophic.

  Detailed communication becomes paramount - providing clear, transparent guidance
  about migration processes, potential risks, and recovery strategies ensures users
  feel secure throughout system updates.

⏺ Excellent question! Database schema evolution is a critical concern, especially for
  an MCP server that users may run for months or years with accumulated GTD data. Let
  me think through the risks and mitigation strategies.

  Major Data Loss Scenarios

  High-Risk Schema Changes:
  1. Column type conversions - Converting TEXT to INTEGER could lose non-numeric data
  2. Table restructuring - Moving from single table to normalized structure
  3. Constraint additions - Adding NOT NULL to existing columns with null values
  4. Primary key changes - Restructuring identity columns
  5. Relationship changes - Modifying foreign key relationships could orphan data

  MCP Server Specific Risks:
  - Users install via uvx - automatic updates could apply breaking changes
  - No IT support - users manage their own data
  - Personal GTD data is irreplaceable (years of organized tasks/projects)
  - Users may not understand database concepts or backup strategies

  Comprehensive Data Preservation Strategy

  1. Pre-Migration Backup System

  def create_migration_backup(db_path: Path, from_version: int, to_version: int) ->
  Path:
      """Create timestamped backup before any schema change"""
      backup_name = f"gtd_backup_v{from_version}_to_v{to_version}_{datetime.now().strft
  ime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.db"
      backup_path = db_path.parent / "backups" / backup_name
      # Copy entire database file
      shutil.copy2(db_path, backup_path)
      return backup_path

  2. Reversible Migration Design

  Every migration should include both upgrade() and downgrade() methods:
  class Migration001(Migration):
      def upgrade(self):
          # Forward changes
          pass

      def downgrade(self):
          # Rollback changes - reconstruct previous state
          pass

  3. Safe Schema Evolution Patterns

  Column Changes:
  - Add columns: Always with DEFAULT values
  - Remove columns: Two-phase (deprecate → remove in later version)
  - Type changes: Add new column → migrate data → verify → drop old

  Table Restructuring:
  def safe_table_restructure():
      # 1. Create new table structure
      # 2. Migrate data with transformation
      # 3. Validate data integrity (counts, relationships)
      # 4. Only drop old table after validation passes

  4. Multi-Stage Migration with Validation

  def execute_migration_with_validation():
      backup_path = create_backup()
      try:
          # Stage 1: Schema changes
          apply_schema_changes()
          validate_schema_integrity()

          # Stage 2: Data migration
          migrate_data()
          validate_data_counts()
          validate_relationships()

          # Stage 3: Cleanup
          cleanup_old_structures()

      except Exception as e:
          # Restore from backup on any failure
          restore_from_backup(backup_path)
          raise MigrationError(f"Migration failed: {e}")

  5. Data Transformation Safeguards

  def migrate_gtd_items_to_normalized():
      """Example: Moving from denormalized to normalized structure"""

      # Count original records
      original_count = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM old_gtd_items").fetchone()[0]

      # Transform and insert
      for row in conn.execute("SELECT * FROM old_gtd_items"):
          # Careful data transformation with error handling
          try:
              insert_transformed_data(row)
          except Exception as e:
              logger.error(f"Failed to migrate row {row['id']}: {e}")
              raise

      # Validate counts match
      new_count = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM new_gtd_items").fetchone()[0]
      if new_count != original_count:
          raise DataIntegrityError(f"Row count mismatch: {original_count} →
  {new_count}")

  6. User-Facing Safety Features

  Backup Management Tool:
  @register_tool
  def create_manual_backup() -> dict:
      """Allow users to create backup before updates"""
      backup_path = create_migration_backup(get_database_path(), current_version,
  current_version)
      return {"backup_created": str(backup_path), "timestamp":
  datetime.now().isoformat()}

  Recovery Tool:
  @register_tool
  def restore_from_backup(backup_file: str) -> dict:
      """Restore database from backup file"""
      # Validate backup file, restore with user confirmation

  7. Migration Testing Strategy

  - Test migrations on copies of real user databases (anonymized)
  - Create test databases with edge cases (null values, constraint violations)
  - Automated testing of upgrade → downgrade → upgrade cycles
  - Performance testing for large datasets

  8. Graceful Failure Handling

  class MigrationManager:
      def apply_migration(self, migration: Migration):
          backup_path = None
          try:
              backup_path = self.create_backup()
              migration.upgrade()
              self.update_schema_version()
              logger.info("Migration completed successfully")

          except Exception as e:
              logger.error(f"Migration failed: {e}")
              if backup_path:
                  self.restore_from_backup(backup_path)
                  logger.info("Database restored from backup")
              raise

  Implementation for Task 2

  For the current Task 2, I'd implement:

  1. Migration framework with automatic backup creation
  2. Schema version tracking with detailed migration history
  3. Validation functions to verify data integrity after changes
  4. Rollback capability for development and emergency recovery
  5. User tools for manual backup/restore operations

  This approach ensures that even complex future schema changes (like adding RACI
  stakeholder tables or restructuring the GTD workflow) can be applied safely without
  losing user data.

  The key principle: Always preserve user data first, then transform it carefully with
  multiple validation checkpoints.

✻ Thinking…

  This is an excellent question about database schema migration and data loss
  prevention. Let me think through the various scenarios where data loss could occur
  during schema changes and what strategies we can implement to prevent it.

  Scenarios Where Data Loss Could Occur:

  1. Column Removal: If we remove a column, all data in that column is lost
  2. Table Restructuring: Major changes to table structure could require data
  transformation
  3. Data Type Changes: Converting between incompatible data types (e.g., TEXT to
  INTEGER with non-numeric data)
  4. Constraint Addition: Adding NOT NULL constraints to columns with existing NULL
  values
  5. Foreign Key Changes: Restructuring relationships that break existing references
  6. Failed Migrations: Partial migrations that leave the database in an inconsistent
  state

  Strategies to Prevent Data Loss:

  1. Backup-First Approach: Always backup before migration
  2. Multi-Step Migrations: Break breaking changes into multiple steps
  3. Data Preservation Migrations: Temporary columns to preserve data during
  transitions
  4. Rollback Capability: Always ensure we can undo changes
  5. Data Validation: Pre-migration checks to ensure compatibility
  6. Export/Import Options: Ability to export data to external formats
  7. Schema Versioning: Track schema versions and compatibility

  Let me think about how this applies to our GTD system specifically...

  For a GTD system, the data is extremely valuable - losing someone's tasks, projects,
  and contexts would be devastating. We need to be extra careful.

  GTD-Specific Considerations:

  1. Task Data: Actions and projects are mission-critical user data
  2. Context Relationships: Many-to-many relationships that could break
  3. Stakeholder Data: RACI relationships and organizational structure
  4. Timestamps: Audit trails and completion tracking
  5. Status Workflows: GTD status transitions and history

  Advanced Protection Strategies:

  1. Shadow Tables: Keep old schema alongside new during transition

  2. Data Migration Scripts: Explicit data transformation logic
  3. Validation Tests: Ensure data integrity after migration
  4. User Notification: Warn users about potential breaking changes
  5. Export Before Upgrade: Automatic backup creation
  6. Gradual Rollout: Schema changes that maintain backward compatibility

  I'll focus on creating robust migration strategies that protect critical user data
  while allowing system evolution. The key is implementing careful, methodical
  approaches that prioritize data preservation and user experience during any schema
  modifications.

  Specific tactics include writing comprehensive migration scripts that handle complex
  data transformations, creating extensive validation tests to catch potential
  integrity issues, and designing a notification system that keeps users informed about
   potential system changes. We'll ensure multiple layers of data protection through
  automated backups, gradual rollout mechanisms, and careful compatibility checks.

⏺ Excellent question! Database schema migrations are indeed a critical concern,
  especially for an MCP server where users might have accumulated valuable GTD data
  over time. Let me analyze the potential data loss scenarios and mitigation
  strategies.

  Scenarios Where Data Loss Could Occur

  High-Risk Changes

  1. Column Removal: Dropping a column permanently destroys all data in it
  2. Table Restructuring: Major schema changes requiring data transformation
  3. Data Type Incompatibilities: Converting TEXT to INTEGER with non-numeric data
  4. Constraint Additions: Adding NOT NULL to columns with existing NULLs
  5. Foreign Key Restructuring: Breaking existing relationships
  6. Failed Migrations: Partial updates leaving database in corrupted state

  GTD-Specific Vulnerabilities

  - Task/Project Data: Core user data - losing actions or projects is catastrophic
  - Context Relationships: Complex many-to-many relationships that could break
  - RACI Stakeholder Data: Organizational relationships and accountability chains
  - Workflow History: Status transitions and completion timestamps
  - Cross-References: Project→Action relationships, Context assignments

  Comprehensive Data Protection Strategy

  1. Pre-Migration Safeguards

  class MigrationManager:
      def migrate(self, target_version: int) -> bool:
          # Always backup before migration
          backup_path = self.create_backup()

          # Validate current data integrity
          if not self.validate_data_integrity():
              raise MigrationError("Data integrity check failed")

          # Check migration compatibility
          if not self.check_migration_compatibility(target_version):
              raise MigrationError("Migration would cause data loss")

  2. Safe Migration Patterns

  Multi-Step Migrations (for breaking changes):
  -- Step 1: Add new column
  ALTER TABLE gtd_items ADD COLUMN new_status_v2 TEXT;

  -- Step 2: Migrate data
  UPDATE gtd_items SET new_status_v2 = old_status;

  -- Step 3: (Later version) Drop old column
  ALTER TABLE gtd_items DROP COLUMN old_status;

  Shadow Table Approach (for major restructuring):
  -- Create new table alongside old
  CREATE TABLE gtd_items_v2 AS SELECT * FROM gtd_items;
  -- Transform data in new table
  -- Validate transformation
  -- Atomic swap: RENAME TABLE gtd_items TO gtd_items_old, gtd_items_v2 TO gtd_items;

  3. Advanced Protection Mechanisms

  Data Preservation Columns:
  -- Temporary preservation during transitions
  ALTER TABLE gtd_items ADD COLUMN _migration_backup_data TEXT;
  UPDATE gtd_items SET _migration_backup_data = json_object(
      'old_status', status,
      'old_type', item_type
  );

  Export-Based Safety Net:
  def create_full_export(self) -> Path:
      """Export all GTD data to JSON before migration."""
      export_data = {
          'version': self.get_schema_version(),
          'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
          'gtd_items': self.export_table('gtd_items'),
          'contexts': self.export_table('contexts'),
          'stakeholders': self.export_table('stakeholders'),
          # ... all tables
      }
      return self.write_export(export_data)

  4. Migration Validation & Rollback

  Post-Migration Validation:
  def validate_migration(self) -> bool:
      checks = [
          self.verify_row_counts(),  # No data disappeared
          self.verify_foreign_keys(),  # All relationships intact
          self.verify_constraints(),  # All business rules maintained
          self.verify_data_types(),  # No corruption during conversion
      ]
      return all(checks)

  Guaranteed Rollback:
  class Migration:
      def upgrade(self) -> None:
          # Forward migration
          pass

      def downgrade(self) -> None:
          # REQUIRED - must reverse all changes
          pass

      def can_rollback(self) -> bool:
          # Check if rollback would cause data loss
          return True

  5. User Protection Features

  Pre-Migration Warnings:
  def assess_migration_risk(self, target_version: int) -> MigrationRisk:
      """Analyze potential data loss before migration."""
      risk_factors = []

      if self.involves_column_drops(target_version):
          risk_factors.append("Column removal - potential data loss")

      if self.involves_data_type_changes(target_version):
          risk_factors.append("Data type changes - validation required")

      return MigrationRisk(
          level="HIGH" if risk_factors else "LOW",
          warnings=risk_factors,
          backup_recommended=True
      )

  6. Emergency Recovery Options

  Database Repair Tools:
  class DatabaseRecovery:
      def repair_from_backup(self, backup_path: Path) -> bool:
          """Restore from automatic backup."""

      def repair_from_export(self, export_path: Path) -> bool:
          """Rebuild database from JSON export."""

      def merge_partial_data(self, sources: list[Path]) -> bool:
          """Combine data from multiple sources after corruption."""

  Implementation Priority for Task 2

  Given these concerns, I'd recommend enhancing our migration system with:

  1. Mandatory Backups: Every migration creates timestamped backup
  2. Dry-Run Mode: Test migrations without applying changes
  3. Data Validation: Pre/post migration integrity checks
  4. Export Safety Net: JSON export before any risky migration
  5. Rollback Testing: Verify every migration can be undone
  6. User Notifications: Clear warnings about potential data impact

  This makes our migration system much more robust than typical "ALTER TABLE"
  approaches, which is essential for preserving users' GTD data that represents their
  entire task management system.

> Sounds great

⏺ Great! Now let me present the complete implementation plan for Task 2 that
  incorporates these robust data protection strategies.

⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
